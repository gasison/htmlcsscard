## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

This is a challenge that I had completed from FrontEndMentor. This project is HTML and CSS only, I had to make sure I used flexbox and grid to layout my work as I found this easier to visualise the result. I first started without the layout and making sure it is similar to the design, then I carried on to formatting the text styles. I learned that grid is much easier to work with in terms of layouts and flexbox is good when aligning items inside the content.
